# .env file

You must create a .env file which looks like this. 

```
    LOCAL_HOST = "localhost"
    DEFAULT_PORT = "8080"
    DEFAULT_PORT2 = "8081"
    DEFAULT_PORT3 = "8082"
    DEFAULT_PORT4 = "8083"
```

# Output

```
    npm run dev
```

note : you can modify the .env file to change port number. but please dont. keep it default and simple.

1. Output usually comes at http://localhost:8080/ - default port
1. Output usually comes at http://localhost:8081/ - api server json and all
    1. http://localhost:8081/user 
    1. http://localhost:8081/dummycar
1. Output usually comes at http://localhost:8082/ - serve plain text
1. Output usually comes at http://localhost:8083/ - serve bootstrap site
